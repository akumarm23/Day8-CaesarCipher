A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher in Python.

## Overview

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This implementation allows the user to encode or decode messages using the Caesar Cipher with a specified shift value.

## Features

- Encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Adjustable shift value for custom encryption.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akumarm23/Day8-CaesarCipher.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd caesar-cipher
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts to input the direction ('encode' or 'decode'), the message, and the Caesar Cipher shift number.

## Example

```bash
Type 'encode' or 'decode: 
encode
Type your Message: 
hello
Type the Caesar-Cipher SHIFT number: 
3
The encoded text is khoor
```
